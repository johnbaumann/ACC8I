# ACC8I

A Crappy Chip-8 Interpreter


## Note
This project is still a work in progress. The PC version still has several bugs and there is currently no sound or input. The Playstation code is merely a framework at this time.

This project makes use of several open-source softwares:

### Playstation
#### "nugget"
A method of compiling playstation code using modern gcc, a sub-component of PCSX-Redux

### PC
#### ImGui
user interface
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/

#### ImGuiFileDialog
file selection
https://github.com/aiekick/ImGuiFileDialog/

#### imgui_club/imgui_memory_editor
memory hex editor
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_club/

#### chip8-test-rom
a nice yet basic instruction test
https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom/

#### chip8-roms
a fantastic collection of chip8 programs, useful for further testing
